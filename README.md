# Stellardrive Simulator
My first BSc User Experience Design project final piece - a simulator for a car infotainment system which I had designed. 

Version: 1.0
Framework: N/A
Compiled: 08/11/2017, 22:35pm

## Project Information
The aim of the project was to create a prototype website to perform user testing on and then analyse and evaluate the feedback and state what we would do if the project were to be developed further.

## Instructions

Run index.html in any browser.

The code is not server-dependant and should run locally.

## Compatibility

## Known bugs

Sometimes the YouTube video behind the Stellardrive interface does not automatically play. If this happens the prototype can be used with the video hidden by clicking on the 'Toggle Video' button.

This prototype only displays correctly on 1080p (1920x1080) displays. On lower and higher resolution monitors the prototype may not display correctly.
